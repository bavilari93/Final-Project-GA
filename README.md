<p>I always argue with my friends where to go and what to get, so we end it up going to same restaurants.

<p>I spend a lot of time deciding where to go, I check reviews, pictures and price and locations. So knowing what people like nearby where iâ€™m at reduces the semi-crisis I feel every time I try decide where to go eat.

<p>just because we have too many options and all seems amazing makes it so hard to decide where to go every time. With an app that can tell me what restaurant is booming can be a lifesaver
